                Hi there, I'm Ryan Wong, a computer science graduate with a Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Davis, and an Associate's degree from the College of San Mateo. I have experience in various programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with Git, Assembly, Bash, and SQL. In addition, I am familiar with Agile and Waterfall methodologies and have a good understanding of design patterns, data structures, and computational algorithms.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                I have worked as an undergraduate researcher in the Expo Lab and also as a Service Desk Administrator at Model N. These roles have given me exposure to project management, documentation, problem-solving, and troubleshooting, which has helped me develop my skills in working in teams and collaborating effectively.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                In my free time, I like to work on personal projects, such as my Bitcoin Project, which involved implementing a proof-of-work consensus blockchain algorithm and managing the difficulty level of the proof-of-work algorithm to regulate block mining speed. I also created a game called Knight Quest in C# which was cross-platform and involved movement/input, logic, and testing.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Overall, I am passionate about programming and enjoy learning new technologies and languages. I am looking forward to new challenges and opportunities in my career.
